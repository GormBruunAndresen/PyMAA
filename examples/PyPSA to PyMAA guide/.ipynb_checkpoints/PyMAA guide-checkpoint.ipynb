    "PyMAA is a python package for performing Modeling All Alternatives (MAA) analysis on linear optimization problems. The methods are applicable for models of any format, but examples are provided for use with the PyPSA energy system modeling framework.\n",

    "### Installing PyMAA\n",
    "This guide assumes you have Anaconda installed. \n",
    "PyMGA is available on pypi. To install PyMGA, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Open Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "2. Install PyMGA with the command ```pip install PyMAA```\n",
    "3. Installing PyMGA will install all dependent packages.\n",
    "4. A successful install will return <br/>\n",

    "5. PyMGA can now be imported as ```import PyMAA```\n",
    "\n",
    "### OPTIONAL: Using the PyMAA environment\n",
    "If you encounter problems when importing PyMAA, it might be a conflict of packages. Using the PyMAA anaconda environment can be a solution. A \"pymaa_environment.yml\" file is located in the folder with this guide (and also on Github, if needed). To set up the anaconda environment, open anaconda prompt and navigate to the folder with \"pymaa_environment.yml\", such as ```C:\\Users\\Desktop\\PyPSA to PyMAA guide```, using the command:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "cd C:\\Users\\Desktop\\PyPSA to PyMAA guide\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, install the environment use the command:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "conda env create -f pymaa_environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "The process will take some time. When done, in the left menu of Anaconda Navigator, click the \"Environments\" tab, and select pymaa_environment from the list. Go to the \"Home\" tab to install jupyter, spyder or what you prefer in this environment, and continue working with PyMAA. "
