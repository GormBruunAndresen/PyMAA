## Modeling All Alternative Solutions for Highly Renewable Energy Systems

The paper in which the MAA method was originally introduced. The MAA method is used to explore the near-optimal space of the european energy system with 95% CO2 reduction and a slack  value of 10%. The near-optimal space is found to contain many different solutions and scenarios within.

## Intersecting near-optimal spaces: European power systems with more resilience to weather variability

> Link: [Intersecting near-optimal spaces: European power systems with more resilience to weather variability](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106496)

In this paper, MAA analysis is applied to a model of the European energy system. The MAA analysis is repeated 41 times, using 41 different weather years. The resulting near-optimal spaces are intersected, and it is argued that the union between the spaces is the true near-optimal space across the years. They argue that this can save computational time and increase robustness of results, as running a model covering 41 years is computationally infeasible, while running 41 models independently is feasible.
