# PyMAA

## A python package for performing Modeling All Alternatives (MAA) analysis.

This site provides documentation for the PyMAA package, as well as explanations and examples for the different MAA methods available in PyMAA. PyMAA aims to make it easy to perform an MAA analysis on an optimizaton problem, with focus on Energy System Optimization Models (ESOMs) built using the [PyPSA](%5Bhttps://pypsa.org/%5D(https://pypsa.org/)) framework.

The PyMAA package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukasBNordentoft/PyMAA) or directly on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyMAA/).

PyMAA was originally a fork of [PyMGA](https://github.com/TimToernes/PyMGA), but has diverged with new features and formatting.

### What is Modeling All Alternatives?

Modeling All Alternatives is an analysis method for optimization problems, aimed at defining the near-optimal feasible space of a convex optimization problem. It is a branch of Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA).

The general MAA method was first presented in the paper [Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121294).

See more under "What is MAA".
