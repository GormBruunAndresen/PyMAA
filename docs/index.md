# PyMAA

### A python package for performing Modeling All Alternatives (MAA) analysis.

---

This site provides documentation for the PyMAA package, as well as explanations and examples for the different MAA methods available in PyMAA.

---

Modeling All Alternatives is an analysis method for optimization problems, aimed at defining the near-optimal feasible space of a convex optimization problem. It is a branch of Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA). 

The method was first presented in the paper [Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121294).

The PyMAA package aims to make it easy to perform an MAA analysis on an optimizaton problem, with focus on Energy System Optimization Models (ESOMs) built using the [PyPSA]([https://pypsa.org/](https://pypsa.org/)) framework.
