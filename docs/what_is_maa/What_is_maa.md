# What is Modelling All Alternatives (MAA)?

Modeling All Alternatives (MAA) is an analysis method for optimization problems, aimed at defining the near-optimal feasible space of a convex optimization problem. It is a branch of Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA).

The general MAA method was first presented in the paper [Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121294). More detail can be found in that paper.

This page serves as a walk-through of the overall method.

## The MGA constraint

To find the near-optimal space, it is necessary to answear the question "What is near-optimal?". Near-optimal solutions are defined as solutions which are acceptably close to the optimum. So, to find out what is near-optimal, the optimal solution and optimal objective value must be known, and a user-defined acceptable deviation must be chosen. When these parameters are known, the MGA constraint is formualted and imposed on the optimization problem. The MGA constraint is:

$$ \begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{x}) \leq f(\mathbf{x}^*) \cdot (1+\epsilon)
\label{mga_constraint}
\end{equation}
$$

Where $$f(\mathbf{x})$$ is the objective function value, $$f(\mathbf{x}^*)$$ is the optimal objective function value, and $$\epsilon$$ is the percentage slack on the objective function value, which determines how much the objective value is allowed to deviate from the optimum. 

The near-optimal space, $$W$$, can then be defined as a subspace of the feasible space, $$X$$, as:

$$ \begin{equation}
W = (\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{x} \in X, \quad f(\mathbf{x}) \leq f(\mathbf{x}^*) )
\label{nos_definition}
\end{equation}
$$

These definitions originate from Modelling To Generate Alternatives (MGA), and are shared betwene MGA and MAA. However, typical MGA methods differ from MAA methods in that they aim to find a number of near-optimal alternatives on the boundary of the near-optimal space, whereas the MAA method aims to find the entire continous near-optimal space. The following figure illustrates the near-optimal space for a simple optimization problem.

With the modelling definition of the near-optimal space in order, it must now be mapped. To do this, the MAA method
