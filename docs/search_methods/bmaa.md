# bMAA method description

> The bMAA method was first introduced in the paper Bounding the near-optimal solution space (Not yet published).

The bMAA method (Bounded Modlling All Alterntaives) uses hyperplanes to define the polytope. Each vertex of the polytope is associated with a search direction. For each iteration, the upper and lower bounds of the polytope are calculated. By drawing a small number of samples (~5000) from within the polytope, the ratio of samples inside the upper bound and inside the lower bound is used to determine the next search direction.

 This continues iteratively, until the search is stopped by a user defined criteria. 

> **Pros**: Suitable for problems of any dimension
> 
> **Cons**: Polytope not defined as the convex hull, but as the hyperplanes defined by the search directions and found vertices.

The bMAA method bounds are illustrated here:

## *class* PyMAA.methods.MAA(case)

Create a method object using the bMAA method, for a given case object

> Example: `method = PyMAA.methods.bMAA(case)`

**Parameters**

| Name | Type        | Description                                                                                |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| case | case object | PyMAA case object containing the optimization problem and required methods. See case page. |

## find_optimum()

Find the optimum solution to the given case object. This is the same regardless of method chosen (MAA/bMAA)

> Example: `opt_sol, obj = method.find_optimum()`

**Returns**

| Name    | Type  | Description                                                            |

| opt_sol | List  | List of the optimal values for chosen variables set in the case object |
| obj     | float | objective function value at the optimum solution                       |

## bMAA.search_directions()

Performs the MAA analysis using the given method for the given case object.

> Example: `vertices, directions, stat, cost = method.search_directions(n_samples = 500, n_workers = 16)`

**Parameters**

| Name             | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
