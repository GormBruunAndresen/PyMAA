## Hit-and-Run description

Hit-and-Run sampling works by taking a random starting point from within the polytope. Then, a random direction is drawn, and a line is created in the random direction which goes through the point. This line meets the boundary at two points. With the line defined, a sample is drawn from a random position along the line.

The Hit-and-Run process then continues iteratively, where the sample point on the line and a new random direction is used to create another line from which a sample is drawn, and so on.

Hit-and-Run sampling is illustrated here:

## PyMAA.sampler.har_sample()

Sample evenly within a polytope using the Hit-and-Run method. If initial point, *x0*, is not within polytope, the sampler automatically calculates a new point within the polytope to use.

> samples = har_sample(n_samples = 1_000, 
>                      x0 = np.zeros(len(vertices.columns)), 
>                      directions = directions, 
>                      vertices = vertices)
