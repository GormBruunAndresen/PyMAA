## Bayesian Bootstrap description

> **Note:** Bayesian Bootstrap is not suited for high-dimension polytopes (6+ dimensions) because the convex hull must be calculated, and QuickHull cant handle high dimensions.

Bayesian Bootstrap sampling works by calculating the convex hull of the polytope, from the v-representation (vertices) of the polytope. Then, the simplexes that consititute the polytope are obtained using Delaunay Triangulation. Each simplex is sampled individually, and the number of samples to draw from a simplex is determined by the share of the total volume for the simplex. 

Each simplex, $$P$$, is represented by its vertices, $$P = \{p^1, p^2, ..., p^{d+1}\}$$, where $$d$$ is the dimension of the polytope from which the simplexes originate.  The vectors pointing to these vertices are contained in the set of vectors, $$V = \{\mathbf{V}_1, \mathbf{V}_2, ..., \mathbf{V}_{d+1} \}$$. These vectors will be used to draw a random sample, once they have been scaled using the scaling vector, $$\mathbf{s}$$. 

The sum of the elements of the scaling vectors, $$\mathbf{s}$$,  must be 1, aka: $$\sum_i \mathbf{s} = 1$$. To construct $$\mathbf{s}$$, the random vector $$r$$ must be constructed. $$\mathbf{r}$$ is constructed by by drawing $$d$$ random numbers from a normal distribution between 0 and 1, sorting them in ascending order, and then adding 0 as the first element and 1 as the last element. For a polytope with $$d = 3$$, $$\mathbf{r}$$ could be:

$$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:r}
\mathbf{r} = \{0, 0.23, 0.45, 0.91, 1\}
\end{equation}
$$

The resulting $$\mathbf{r}$$ has $$d + 2$$ elements. Now, the difference between these components in chronological order can be used to find $$\mathbf{s}$$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{s} = {r_{i+1} - r_i} \qquad \forall \qquad i = 1, 2, ..., (d+1)
\end{equation}
$$

This method ensures that the sum of the elements of $$\mathbf{s}$$ is 1. The example vector from equation $$\ref{eq:r}$$ thus results in $$\mathbf{s} = \{0.23, 0.22, 0.46, 0.09\}$$. $$\mathbf{s}$$ and $$V$$ ends up having the same number of elements.

With the scaling vector $$\mathbf{s}$$ constructed from the random vector $$\mathbf{r}$$, a new sample point can the be drawn from within the simplex, as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P}_{new} = \sum^{d+1}_{i=1} (\mathbf{V}_i \cdot s_i)
\end{equation}
$$

To draw a new, differenet sample, simply create new random elements in $$\mathbf{r}$$, construct a new $$\mathbf{s}$$, and calculate a new point. This process is repeated for each simplex, with more samples drawn from larger simplices according to how large a share of the polytope volume each simplex is.

Bayesian Bootstrap sampling of a single simplex is illustrated here:
