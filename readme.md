## PyMGA.methods

#### PyMGA.methods.MGA(case)

**PyMGA.methods.MGA.find_optimum()**   
Finds the cost optimal solution of the case object given

**PyMGA.methods.MGA.serach_directions(n_samples, n_workers)**   
Performs the MGA study on the case study. The method draws random search directions uniformly over the hypersphere.  

*n_samples:* The number of samples to draw  
*n_workers:* number of parallel process to start. Default=4

#### PyMGA.methods.MAA

**PyMGA.methods.MAA.find_optimum()**   
Finds the cost optimal solution of the case object given

**PyMGA.method.MAA.search_directions(self, n_samples, n_workers, max_iter)**

Runs the MAA algorithm documented in [Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121294)

*n_samples:* Maximum number of samples to draw  
*n_workers:* number of parallel process to start. Default=4  
*max_iter:* Maximum number of MAA iterations  

#### PyMGA.methods.bMAA<br>

**PyMGA.methods.bMAA.find_optimum()**<br>
Finds the cost optimal solution of the case object given

**PyMGA.methods.bMAA.serach_directions(n_samples, har_samples, n_workers, max_iter, tol)**<br>

*n_samples:* Maximum number of samples to draw  <br>
*har_samples:* Number of MAA samples to draw when computing acceptance rate and finding new directions. Default=5000  <br>
*n_workers:* number of parallel process to start. Default=4  <br>
*max_iter:* maximum number of iterations to perfom. Default = 30  <br>
*tol:* The acceptance rate required before terminating, unless n_samples is reached first. A number between 0-1. Default = 0.99  <br>

#### PyMGA.cases<br>

**PyMGA.cases.PyPSA_case(config, base_network_path variables=None, tmp_network_path='tmp/networks/tmp.h5', n_snapshots=100, mga_slack=0.1)**<br>

This class represents a PyPSA_Eur or PyPSA_Eur_Sec network as a case that can be investigated by the MGA methods. <br>

*config:* Config file containing the solver options<br>
*base_network_path:* Path to the network file <br>
*variables:* A dict specifying the variables to be investigated by the MGA/MAA methods <br>
*n_snapshots:* Number of snapshots to include from the given network. <br>
*mga_slack:* Percent MGA slack to use as a fraction, e.g. 0.1 = 10%<br>
*tmp_network_path:* Path where to store temporary network files<br>

**PyMGA.cases.Cube(dim,cuts)**<br>
A synthetic tescase of testing MGA/MAA methods. The method creates an optimization problem with a solution space in the form of a cube sliced with n cuts. <br>

*dim:* Number of dimensions of the test case <br>
*cuts:* Number of cuts <br>

**PyMGA.cases.CubeCorr(dim)**<br>
A synthetic tescase of testing MGA/MAA methods. The method creates an optimization problem with a solution space in the form of a cube sliced by parallel planes to give the space strong correlations between variables.<br>

*dim:* Number of dimensions of the test case<br>

**PyMGA.cases.CrossPoly(dim)**<br>
A synthetic tescase of testing MGA/MAA methods. The method creates an optimization problem with a solution space in the form of the intersection of a hyperube and a cross-polytope. <br>

*dim:* Number of dimensions of the test case <br>
